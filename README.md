# Tab Shui
#### *Cause a cluttered window leads to a cluttered mind*

Some people are just naturally orderly. Their home is always clean, their shirts are always perfectly ironerd and if you catch a climpse at their browser there is only one open window with maximum 5 tabs. 
Some of my best friends are like this, and one particular day I looked at my 5 windows with 50-100 open tabs each and realiize I have to change something. And I tried, but it usually takes about 10 minutes of notpaying attention, clicking through hyperlinks and again I face tens of open tabs and I feel like I can't close any them because they all seem important.
That's when I realized I need some kind of outside control mechanism, and I decided a small browser extension would do the trick!

## Features
* Set maximum amount of windows and tabs
* Automatically close any exceeding window or tab
